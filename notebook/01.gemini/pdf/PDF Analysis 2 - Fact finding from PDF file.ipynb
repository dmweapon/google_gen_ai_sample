According to the graph, the percentage of organizations using generative AI jumped from 33% in 2023 to 65% in 2024. That's an increase of 32 percentage points.\n2. The most commonly used function for generative AI in 2024 is Marketing and Sales, with 34% of respondents reporting its use.\n3. The PDF doesn't explicitly explain why the Energy and Materials sector is the most commonly using generative AI. However, we can infer reasons based on the industry's characteristics:\n\n    - **Data-driven Operations:** The energy and materials sector is heavily reliant on data for exploration, production, and supply chain management. Gen AI can be used to analyze vast amounts of data, optimize resource allocation, predict demand, and improve efficiency in these processes. \n    - **Complex Processes:** Energy and materials involve complex operations and workflows. Gen AI can help streamline these processes, automate tasks, and enhance decision-making through predictive analytics and simulations.\n    - **Innovation and R&D:** Gen AI can be used for material science research, development of new energy sources, and exploring innovative technologies in the sector. \n\nOverall, the Energy and Materials sector seems well-suited to leverage the capabilities of generative AI to improve efficiency, optimize operations, and drive innovation.\n"},"metadata":{}}]}]}
